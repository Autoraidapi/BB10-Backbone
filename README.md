# BB10-Backbone

This is a new fork of [DevTools Pro for BlackBerry 10](https://github.com/anpho/DevTools-Pro) from another developer.

I hope to address some issues with the javascript in this repository, and use it's strategy for binding javascript to the blackberry cascades c++ framework with qml.

This list outlines some of the things that I would change. I will provide further details to what and why I would make these changes.

- Formatting
- Mixins
- Sandboxing
- Persistance
- WebViews
- PostMessage
